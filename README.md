# AndroidIAPP Godot Plugin

AndroidIAPP is a [plugin](<https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html#installing-a-plugin>) for the Godot game engine. It provides an interface to work with Google Play Billing Library version 7. The plugin supports all public functions of the library, passes all error codes, and can work with different subscription plans.

A simple game to demonstrate the work of purchases and subscriptions with different tariff plans: [Circle Ð¡atcher 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.godotengine.circlecatcher)

## Features

- Connect to Google Play Billing.
- Query purchases.
- Query product details.

## Installation

- And place the unpacked plugin folder in the `res://addons/` directory of the project.

> [!NOTE]
> Dont forget to enable the plugin in the project settings.

## SIMPLE DEBUG

 - Make sure this plugin is activate in Project > Project Settings > Plugins
 - After you install the plugins, Check the AndroidIAPP.gd, make sure the path of .aar file is right 

 `if debug:
			return PackedStringArray(["AndroidIAPP-debug.aar"])
		else:
			return PackedStringArray(["AndroidIAPP-release.aar"])`

 - this is just a billing helper file, you need something like this (https://gist.github.com/nitish800/60a1f3b6e746805b67a68395ca8f4ca6) and actually run this as autoload

- Another [Example](https://gist.github.com/code-with-max/56881cbb3796a19a68d8eabd819d6ff7)

## Before start

- Google Play Billing uses these three types of purchases:
  - Products that will be consumed ("inapp").
  - Products that will be acknowledged ("inapp").
  - Subscriptions that will be purchased and consumed ("subs").

  And their IDs should be passed to the function as a list of String elements. Even if there is only one ID, it still needs to be wrapped in a list.

- All public methods and values returned by Google Play Billing are presented as a typed Godot dictionary. All dictionary keys represent the names of public methods written in snake_case style.
  - getProductId -> `product_id`
  - getSubscriptionOfferDetails -> `subscription_offer_details`

  See the variant of response [here](https://github.com/code-with-max/godot-google-play-iapp/blob/master/examples/details_inapp.json)

- The plugin also includes all standard [BillingResponseCode](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/BillingClient.BillingResponseCode) messages as a key in the dictionary called `response_code`. Additionally, it adds a `debug_message` key if the code indicates an error.

> [!NOTE]
> This is where the biggest difference from the official plugin begins.
